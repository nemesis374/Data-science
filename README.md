A CSE (Data Science) student with a goal-oriented mindset and good communication skills, possessing
intermediate knowledge in programming, enjoys competitive programming, playing games and working out.

--This project is about Classification of Multiple Disease based on various parameters such as-
itching,
skin_rash,
nodal_skin_eruptions,
continuous_sneezing,
shivering,
chills,
.
.
.
.
.
blister,
red_sore_around_nose,
yellow_crust_ooze,

The prediction/classification is done using the 8 steps - 
Step 1 : import library
Step 2 : import data
Step 3 : define y and X
Step 4 : train test split(check shape of train and test sample)
Step 5 : select model
Step 6 : train or fit model
Step 7 : predict model
Step 8 : model accuracy
Other than this we have used another technique as well to check for the model accuracy
